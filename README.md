# Knowledge-graph

This project implements a **Graph-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline to extract entities and relationships from PDF documents and build a structured knowledge graph. It allows:

- Multi-hop reasoning and explainable queries over PDF data.
- Scalable processing using chunking, caching, and parallel API calls.
- Visualization of entity relationships using NetworkX.

**Technologies Used:** Python, PyMuPDF, NetworkX, Google Gemini API, JSON, concurrent.futures

**Example Use Case:** Extracting insights from Tesla annual reports with explainable relational queries.
